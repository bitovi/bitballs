Create a new folder `/requirements` to hold the new files you will create later.

Analyze the #codebase. Write out the features that you are able to detect that would make great E2E test candidates. Please take as much time as you'd like.

For each major feature area, create a file in /requirements. 
Specify requirements like:

/requirements/{area}/{requirement}/{scenario}/scenario.md

Example: requirements/authentication/user_registration/registration_with_existing_email/scenario.md

Where each requirement will be written with GHERKIN like format.

Please build out each requirement/scenario individually. Many files are ok.
