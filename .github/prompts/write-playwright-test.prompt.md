-->

You are going to take a use case, plus some additional context, and write a Playwright test for that use case.

To do this, you will use the Playwright MCP (Multi-Context Processor) to analyze the page and perform the task.

You will open up `http://localhost:5001` and use the Playwright MCP to figure out how to complete the use case.

When complete, write out the Playwright test code that accomplishes the use case. The test code should be in a single file, and should be ready to run. Save the file in the `app-requirements/tests` folder.

Lastly, run the test to ensure it works as expected. If it fails, debug and fix the test until it passes.
